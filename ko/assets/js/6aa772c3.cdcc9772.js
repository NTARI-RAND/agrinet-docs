We\\nwanted our docs to feel like an application\u2014fluid, responsive, and focused on the journeys that\\nmatter most. Here\'s how we translated that into Agrinet\'s experience.\\n\\n## Hero narrative anchored in outcomes\\n\\nReact Native\'s homepage sets a tone of confident exploration. We mirrored that by framing Agrinet\'s\\nhero around clear actions: explore the federation, activate a cluster, and test your APIs. The\\nlayout relies on a soft gradient backdrop paired with bold typography, yielding a familiar yet fresh\\nlanding moment.\\n\\n## Navigation tuned for builders\\n\\nWe preserved React Native\'s left-aligned nav groupings and emphasized fast access to docs, guides,\\narchitecture notes, and API references. A translucent navbar ensures the calls-to-action stay in\\nview without obstructing content.\\n\\n## Feature cards with motion-ready gradients\\n\\nTo echo the React Native marketing site, we rebuilt our feature callouts as gradient-rich cards with\\nsubtle shadows and spacious padding. Each card connects to a next step\u2014reading tutorials, reviewing\\nlaunch kits, or testing with the Agrinet CLI.\\n\\n## Blog as a storytelling surface\\n\\nWith this update we also introduced the Agrinet blog. Articles lean on vivid hero art, spacious\\nline-height, and clear metadata badges reminiscent of React Native\'s blog roll. Expect engineering\\ndeep-dives, platform updates, and rollout guides to land here regularly.tum dignissim ultricies. Fusce rhoncus ipsum tempor eros aliquam consequat.
