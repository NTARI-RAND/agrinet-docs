Turn Your Louisville Yard into $4,000 Annual Income

## The Opportunity

A typical Louisville yard (5,000–8,000 sq ft) can convert just 400 sq ft into a small-scale, biologically integrated garden capable of yielding $3,000–$4,000 annually.
Louisville’s long growing season (March – December) allows up to 10 harvests a year, with some crops with small cold-protection tools such as row tunnels.

## Integrated Growing Method (1,000 sq ft layout)

| Crop      | Avg. Yield | Key Role            | Income Range | Revenue Range* |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Arugula   | 400 sq ft  | Primary cash crop   | $12/lb       | $5,500–$6,200  |
| Arugula   | 200 sq ft  | Nitrogen fixer      | $10–$11/lb   | $2,200–$2,600  |
| Beans     | 150 sq ft  | Protein-rich crop   | $5/lb        | $750–$950      |
| Garlic    | 50 sq ft   | Pest prevention     | $10/lb       | $1,100–$1,300  |
| Flowers   | 200 sq ft  | Pollinator attractant | $8/bunch  | $600–$800      |

*Arugula sells for $10.50/lb, beans $4.50/lb (dry), garlic $8/lb, flowers $8/bunch. Revenue assumes 37 weeks @ 100 sq ft planting.

## Why the Integrated Method Works

- **Cut-and-Come-Again Production:** Each arugula plant yields multiple harvests (0.3–0.45 lb/plant each year), multiplying total yield and reducing gaps between harvests.
- **Ecological Synergy:**
  - Beans fix nitrogen and feed arugula, which typically supports 70–90% of pests naturally.
  - High-value crops like Mito Arugula’s premium price per pound extends through most pest cycles.
- **Low Upfront Costs:** Seeds, nutrient management total ~$250 per 1,000 sq ft; labor averages 2–3 hours/week (valued at ~$35–$50/hour equivalent).
