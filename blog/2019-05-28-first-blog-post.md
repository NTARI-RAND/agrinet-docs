The Agrinet federation has reached its first public milestone. We pulled from the React Native
playbook to ship an experience that feels polished from day one, prioritizing smooth onboarding,
fast refresh cycles, and deep integrations with familiar tooling.

Our Alpha release focuses on three core journeys:

- **Guided onboarding flows** that mirror the way React Native shepherds developers from zero to
  production-ready builds.
- **Componentized agronomic services** so teams can stitch together experiences using shared
  primitives instead of bespoke integrations.
- **Preview deployments** that let you validate in-field hardware and simulated environments with
  the same toolkit.

If you're ready to explore, start with the [Federation Onboarding guide](/docs/onboarding) and stay
plugged into the [Agrinet GitHub org](https://github.com/agrinet) for release notes.
