Ready to kick the tires on the Agrinet CLI without leaving your browser? We packaged the toolkit into
an interactive playground similar to the React Native Snack environment.

<Tabs groupId="platform">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```bash
npx agrinet-cli@latest init farming-sim --template react-native
cd farming-sim
npm run agrinet:start
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
npx agrinet-cli@latest init farming-sim --template react-native
cd farming-sim
./gradlew agrinet:deploySim
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We're shipping more recipes soon, including deep links into GraphQL Studio and remote sensor
telemetry emulation. Drop your wishlist in the [Agrinet Discussions](https://github.com/agrinet)
