Our new documentation experience borrows heavily from the visual system that powers
[reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev). From the moment you land on the homepage youâ€™ll notice
familiar cues: the sweeping gradient hero, anchored navigation, and prominent "Get Started" action.

We rethought the documentation IA so that teams can chart a clear path from concept to deployed
federation nodes:

- **Start with the overview** to understand how Agrinet stitches together growers, equipment
  partners, and data flows.
- **Dive into onboarding** to configure your first region, with React Native-inspired command-line
  feedback that keeps things fast and predictable.
- **Explore the deployment launch kit** to replicate production-grade setups in staging.

Stick around as we expand the blog with release highlights, UX explorations, and platform tips.

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Here are a few tips you might find useful.

<!-- truncate -->

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
