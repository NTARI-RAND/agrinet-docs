# Agrinet Docs v1.1.0 (Nov 2, 2025)

Agrinet Docs v1.1.0 is a versioned snapshot of the documentation site that corresponds to the 1.1.x series of the Agrinet platform. This release captures stable guides, onboarding, federation, payments, and API-testing content for downstream users and integrators.

## Highlights
- Versioned docs snapshot added: `version-1.1` (under `versioned_docs/version-1.1`)
- New and updated guides:
  - Quickstart: clearer local dev and build instructions
  - Federation: expanded federation-node and compliance guidance
  - Payments: Stripe integration notes and reconciliation guidance
  - Chat UI: configuration and transport options for WebSocket/SSE/polling
  - API Testing Playbook: service ports, example scripts, and troubleshooting
- Docusaurus version dropdown support documented and verified (Next + 1.1 visible when built from publishing branch)
- Sidebar snapshots added for the 1.1 docs set

## Upgrade & migration notes
- Versioning convention: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes
  - MINOR: backward-compatible features
  - MAJOR: breaking changes
- Ensure the publishing branch contains:
  - `versions.json` with `"1.1"` listed
  - `versioned_docs/version-1.1/`
  - `versioned_sidebars/version-1.1-sidebars.json`
- After merging these files into your publishing branch, run your usual build/deploy flow to publish the updated dropdown and pages.
